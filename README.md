## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS collects massive amounts of data from all over the world each and every day.

The purpose of this project is to build a new tool for USGS that will allow them to visualize their data; specifically, earthquakes. This visualization tool can then shared with the public for educational purposes, as well as other governmental organizations for funding requests.


## Result
The Earthquake Visulization Map: 
<li> The new interactive map visually illustrates earthquakes all over the globe. </li>
<li> The dataset focuses on all earthquakes within the past seven days. </li>
<li> Each earthquake is represented by a marker: the size of the marker indicates the magnitude and the color indicates the depth of the earthquake. </li>
<li> Each marker (circle) can be clicked on to get further details on the earthquake (location, date, and magnitude). </li>
